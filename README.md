> Tip for Common-sense people:
Install AMD Panel & after that, backup all your regedit.
Open Panel & configurate it.
Now save again your regedit and compare the changes (related to AMD obviously).
Now you have your settings in a Regedit file! The next time u dont even need install the fucking AMD panel.
